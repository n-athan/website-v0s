        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my little contribution to the world wide web. I like exploring web design, mathematics, animations, art, and everything else that happens to temporarily grab my interest.</p><p>On this website you can find some of my projects. They are listed here below, with a short explanation of what inspired them and how they work.</p><p>Enjoy!</p>

        <h2><a href='https://v0s.nl/timestables/'>Times Tables</a></h2>
        <p>This is a mesmerising animation of times tables on a circle. Looking at it for long periods of time might just be very relaxing. You can change the number of points on the circle, the times table to draw and the size of the steps of the animation. </p>
        <p>Based on the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhbuKbxJsk8" target="_blank">Times Tables, Mandelbrot and the Heart of Mathematics</a> by Mathologer on YouTube. </p>

        <h2><a href="https://v0s.nl/brickify">Brickify</a></h2>
        <p>Change any image to make it look like it is made out of 1x1 LEGO bricks. It draws a transformed image on an HTML canvas, so you can download the resultant image to your own device. </p> <p>There are options to choose the level of pixelation or the number of bricks across or up and down of the result. However, the larger the total amount of bricks to draw, the longer it takes to draw them!</p>
        <p>Currently it is only possible to choose an image from a few selected ones already present.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://v0s.nl/klok">de klok</a></h2> 
        <p>A page reminiscent of <em>de stijl</em>. Between orthogonal lines, geometric shapes and bright colors you can read the time, date and an inspiring (at least I hope so) quote.</p> <p><em>de klok</em> was one of my first projects in which I used CSS Grid, but I have been using Grid ever since. It has been super easy to put content exactly where you need it on a page, without relying on the other content.</p><p>This project was directly inspired by the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxrsO4aIjyc" target="_blank">CSS Grid like you are Jan Tschichold</a> by <a href="https://labs.jensimmons.com/" target="_blank">Jen Simmons</a>. She has a very helpful website with a lot of experimental grid designs.</p>

        <h2><a href='https://v0s.nl/eyes'>Vierkante Oogjes</a></h2>
        <p>Vierkante oogjes (<em>square eyes</em>) is a dutch idiom used when someone is looking at a digital screen too much.</p><p>I'm not sure what inspired this page. Perhaps simply the possiblity of making it.</p>
